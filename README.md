TDD Student Directory
=====================

This was the second assignment at Makers - to recreate as much of the functionality of the [original student directory](https://github.com/Arepo/student-directory) via TDD.

It was also our first introduction to real pair programming, which meant effectively restarting two or three times with new partners, so in the end this is a set of conceptually related methods rather than anything that could pass as a program.
